        "Have you ever wondered if Oak trees in California release pollen during the spring, which is when seasonal allergies are most common? Furthermore, do specific types of Oak trees in California show a preference for coastal climates over inland ones? In this module, we will utilize phenometric data from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) to generate a graph that displays the pollen release patterns of Oak trees in California. Additionally, we will construct interactive maps to illustrate the geographic distribution of various Oak species in California.\n",

The figure below provides an overview of the distinctions, while the succeeding sections offer detailed information about each type. For a comprehensive understanding of the USA-NPN approach and guidelines for working with each data type, refer to the following [documentation](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2018/1060/ofr20181060.pdf).\n",
